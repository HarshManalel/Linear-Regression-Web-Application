# Linear Regression and Outlier Detection

📊 A web application that implements linear regression and outlier detection techniques on various datasets. It provides a user-friendly interface for selecting datasets, customizing regression parameters, and generating scatter plots with regression lines. The application also highlights any detected outliers in the plots.

## Features

🔍 Perform linear regression on multiple datasets  
📈 Detect and visualize outliers in the scatter plots  
🎨 Customize plot colors for background, regression line, and outliers  
📄 Generate a downloadable PDF report summarizing the analysis  

## Technologies Used

🐍 Python  
🌐 Flask (web framework)  
📊 Matplotlib (plotting library)  
📊 Pandas (data manipulation library)  
🤖 Scikit-learn (machine learning library)  
📄 ReportLab (PDF generation library)  

## Installation

1. Clone the GitHub repository:
git clone https://github.com/HarshManalel/Linear-Regression-and-Outlier-Detection-Web-Application

### 💻 Architecture

The web application is built using Flask, a Python web framework. The user interface is designed using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and the server-side scripts are written in Python. The data processing is done using Pandas, and the machine learning algorithms are implemented using Scikit-learn.

### 📈 Algorithm

The web application implements Linear Regression adn the plots and its colors can be selected by the user . The results are displayed in a scatter plot, which can be downloaded as a PNG file.

### 🌟 Features

- Upload CSV file
- Select relevant features
- Choose the number of clusters
- Download the scatter plot as a PNG file

### 🎨 UI/UX

The user interface is designed using Bootstrap and custom CSS. The application uses jQuery for dynamic content loading and AJAX requests
